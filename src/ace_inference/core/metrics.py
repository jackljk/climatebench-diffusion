    .. Author: Salva RÃ¼hling Cachay

    pytorch version of https://github.com/TheClimateCorporation/properscoring/blob/master/properscoring/_crps.py#L187

    This implementation is based on the identity:
    .. math::
        CRPS(F, x) = E_F|X - x| - 1/2 * E_F|X - X'|
    where X and X' denote independent random variables drawn from the forecast
    distribution F, and E_F denotes the expectation value under F.

    We use the fair, unbiased formulation of the ensemble CRPS, which is better for small ensembles.
    Basically, we use n_members * (n_members - 1) instead of n_members**2 to average over the ensemble spread.
    See Zamo & Naveau (2018; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11004-017-9709-7) for details.
